# Local Micro-Events Social Network (JoyJoin)

## Overview

JoyJoin (悦聚·Joy) is a social networking platform designed to foster meaningful local connections through curated micro-events (5-10 attendees). It leverages AI for intelligent user matching based on interests, personality, and social compatibility, with a strong emphasis on psychological safety and inclusivity. Primarily targeting the Hong Kong/Shenzhen market, JoyJoin aims to build community by connecting individuals for shared experiences. Key capabilities include AI-powered matching, a comprehensive feedback system, streamlined event management, and a robust Admin Portal. A core innovation is the 12-Archetype Animal Social Vibe System, which enhances sophisticated group dynamics and chemistry matching.

## System Architecture

### Frontend
- **Frameworks:** React 18 with TypeScript, Vite, Wouter for routing.
- **UI/Styling:** Mobile-first design using Radix UI primitives, shadcn/ui (New York style), and Tailwind CSS. Supports dark mode, a purple-centric warm color palette, and is bilingual (Chinese/English).
- **State Management:** TanStack Query for server state.
- **Animations:** Framer-motion for UI transitions and effects.
- **Key UI Patterns:** Bottom navigation, event cards, two-part match scoring, personality radar charts, social role cards, progressive disclosure, and registration progress indicators.
- **Design Principles:** Emphasizes warmth, accessibility, responsive design, and progressive anxiety reduction.

### Backend
- **Runtime:** Node.js with Express.js, TypeScript.
- **API Design:** RESTful API.
- **Payment System:** Integrated WeChat Pay structure.

### Data Storage
- **Database:** PostgreSQL (Neon serverless) with Drizzle ORM.
- **Schema:** Manages Users, Events, Matching Algorithm data, Feedback/Ratings, and Admin Portal entities (venues, eventTemplates, subscriptions, payments, coupons).
- **Migrations:** Drizzle Kit.

### Authentication & Authorization
- **User Authentication:** Phone number + SMS verification.
- **Session Management:** `express-session` with PostgreSQL storage.
- **Admin Authorization:** `isAdmin` flag for portal access.

### System Features & Design Decisions
- **Two-Stage Event Pool Matching Model:** Admin defines event pools with hard constraints; users register with soft preferences. An AI-driven, 5-dimensional algorithm (personality, interest, background, conversation, intent) matches users within pools, incorporating a 12-Archetype Animal Social Vibe System and a real-time dynamic matching service.
- **AI-Driven Matchmaking:** Utilizes AI for sophisticated event and people matching, focusing on personality, interests, and group dynamics, with explainable results and a deep feedback system.
- **Two-Tier Feedback Architecture:** Collects both basic and optional anonymous deep feedback to continuously refine matching algorithms.
- **Gamified Personality Assessment:** A 10-question test determines social role archetypes, visualized with a Personality Radar Chart, requiring re-assessment for the new 12-archetype system.
- **Streamlined Onboarding:** Multi-step registration covering identity, interests, personality, and profile creation, enhanced with UX features like progress indicators and celebratory animations.
- **Admin Portal:** Desktop-first interface for comprehensive management (users, subscriptions, events, finance, moderation, insights), including an Admin Matching Lab for real-time algorithm tuning.
- **Payment & Subscription System:** Full payment infrastructure including WeChat Pay integration, webhook handling, and subscription management.
- **Intelligent Venue Matching & Booking:** Algorithm-based venue scoring and a transactional booking system with race condition protection.
- **AI Chat Registration:** New AI-powered conversational registration flow using a character-based AI for a more engaging user onboarding experience, extracting user information securely server-side.
- **Personalized Icebreaker Topics:** Curated icebreaker topics generated by an algorithm that considers common interests, archetype composition, and difficulty levels, with personalized recommendation reasons.
