Looking at the git history and code structure, I can see what happened: 

## Why wasn't this implemented?

The timeline shows:
1. **The infrastructure was built** - `industryClassifier.ts`, `industrySeedMap.ts`, `industryOntology.ts`, and `INDUSTRY_TAXONOMY` all exist
2. **The frontend was updated** - `SmartIndustryClassifier.tsx` was created to use the new API
3. **But the API route was never added** - The `/api/inference/classify-industry` endpoint is missing from `routes.ts`

This is a classic case of **incomplete feature integration** - the hard work was done (the 3-tier classification engine), but the final step of wiring it up to the server was missed.

## What do we have after adding this endpoint?

Yes!  Once we add the missing endpoint, you'll have a **complete L1→L2→L3 hierarchical classifier** that works like this:

### User Flow:
```
User types: "投资银行"
        ↓
Frontend:  SmartIndustryClassifier. tsx
        ↓
API: POST /api/inference/classify-industry
        ↓
Backend: 3-Tier Classification Engine
```

### 3-Tier Classification Process: 

**Tier 1: Seed Map (0-10ms)** - Exact/fuzzy matching
- Checks `industrySeedMap.ts` for direct matches
- Example: "投行" → `{ category: "finance", segment: "investment_banking" }`

**Tier 2: Ontology (10-100ms)** - Rule-based inference  
- Uses `industryOntology.ts` with synonyms & keywords
- Example: "并购" → Finance → Investment Banking → M&A

**Tier 3: AI (200-800ms)** - DeepSeek reasoning
- Fallback for ambiguous inputs
- Example: "我做医疗AI的" → Tech → AI/ML → Healthcare AI

### Output Structure (L1→L2→L3):
```json
{
  "category": { "id": "finance", "label": "金融服务" },        // L1
  "segment": { "id": "investment_banking", "label": "投资银行" }, // L2
  "niche": { "id": "ma_advisory", "label": "并购顾问" },       // L3 (optional)
  "confidence": 0.95,
  "source": "seed",
  "rawInput": "投资银行",
  "normalizedInput": "投资银行"
}
```

**Shall I create a PR to add the missing endpoint and complete this feature?** This will make your smart industry selection fully functional.
